# follow-up work


- This repo is no longer actively maintained, but two repos are actively maintaing / extending contextual decomposition:

  1. [Hierarchical neural network interpretations repo](https://github.com/csinva/hierarchical-dnn-interpretations) - extends CD to CNNs / arbitrary DNNs, and aggregates explanations into a hierarchy, code for the paper [Hierarchical interpretations for neural network predictions (ICLR 2019)](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SkEqro0ctQ)
  2.  [Penalizing explanations repo](https://github.com/laura-rieger/deep-explanation-penalization) - penalizes CD explanations in order to improve model performance, under review

# related work
- this work is part of an overarching project, guided by the [PDR framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04592) for interpretable machine learning
